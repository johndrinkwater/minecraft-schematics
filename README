These schematics were built before command blocks, before hoppers, before droppers, before comparators, and slightly‐before the change to glowstone/slabs to allow for more compact vertical wiring.

So only useful now for reference sake :) Had big plans for these at the time, but the more complex storage and maths modules were getting … sizeable and I was not happy at their compactness. So I abandoned the project.

Oh well.
